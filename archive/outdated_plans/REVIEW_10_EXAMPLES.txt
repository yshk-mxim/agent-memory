DAY 2 MANUAL REVIEW - 10 Examples to Check
================================================================================


================================================================================
EXAMPLE 1: conflict_001
================================================================================
Conflict Type: tone_professional_vs_friendly
Domain: legal_writing

Turn 1 (user):
  INSTRUCTION: Use strictly professional legal language with formal terminology, avoiding any conversational elements or casual expressions
  CONTENT: I need to draft a cease and desist letter to a competitor who's been using our trademarked brand name

Turn 2 (user):
  INSTRUCTION: Actually, keep the tone warm and friendly throughout, like you're talking to a neighbor you want to maintain good relations with
  CONTENT: This is for a small local business owner who we might work with in the future, so we don't want to burn bridges

Turn 3 (user):
  QUERY: Now provide two versions: first using the professional approach from earlier, then using the casual approach. Show me both.
  WHAT THIS TESTS: System should maintain both Use strictly professional legal language with formal terminology context and Actually context separately. Under KV cache compression, the earlier formal instruction often degrades when casual instruction appears, causing the system to forget the formal constraint. RDIC should isolate these semantic contexts to prevent degradation.
  RDIC VALUE: Maintains isolated KV contexts for each instruction cluster, preventing compression-based degradation when conflicting instructions appear across turns

Ground Truth Clusters: ['professional_legal_authoritative', 'friendly_approachable_conversational']
Purpose: context_isolation_test

Review Checklist (Context Isolation Testing):
  [ ] 1. Genuine Conflict - Do the two instructions create incompatible semantic contexts?
  [ ] 2. Realistic Scenario - Could this context-switching happen in real conversations?
  [ ] 3. Tests Context Isolation - Does Turn 3 require maintaining BOTH contexts separately?
  [ ] 4. Clear Ground Truth - Are the semantic clusters well-separated?
  [ ] 5. RDIC Value - Would isolating KV contexts prevent instruction degradation here?

OVERALL: PASS / FAIL
