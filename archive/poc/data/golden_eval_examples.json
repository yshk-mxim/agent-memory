Patient has significant cardiac risk factors including hypertension (diagnosed 2015), hyperlipidemia (on statin therapy), and family history of MI (father at age 58). Initial vital signs: BP 140/90, HR 88, RR 16, SpO2 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed mild distress but no acute distress, heart sounds regular without murmurs, lungs clear bilaterally. EKG performed immediately showing normal sinus rhythm without ST elevation or depression. Given the constellation of symptoms and risk factors, cardiac etiology cannot be excluded despite normal initial EKG. Troponin ordered and patient placed on continuous cardiac monitoring.",
