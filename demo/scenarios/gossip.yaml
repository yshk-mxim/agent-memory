      The three of you are meeting together.

      IMPORTANT: You have private knowledge from earlier conversations,
      but ONLY say things you'd be comfortable saying in front of everyone.
      Do NOT repeat private gossip directly. You may hint at inside jokes.

      Now you're all in the same room. Be natural.
