# Day 10 (Wednesday): Cluster Validation and Ground Truth Comparison

**Week 2 - Day 3**

---

**Objectives:**
- Compare R1 clusters to ground truth conflict types
- Measure cluster-conflict alignment
- Generate Figure 2 and Table 2

**Tasks:**

| Task | Time | Details |
|------|------|---------|
| Create ground truth mapping | 1h | Map dataset conflict_type to clusters |
| Compute cluster-GT alignment | 1h | Precision, recall per cluster |
| Implement confusion matrix | 1h | R1 clusters vs GT types |
| Analyze misalignments | 1h | Why do some disagree? |
| Generate Figure 2 | 1h | Cluster-conflict heatmap |
| Generate Table 2 | 30m | Cluster taxonomy table |
| Write clustering results | 1.5h | Section 3 draft |

**Files to Create:**
- `/Users/dev_user/semantic/experiments/exp2_validation.py`
- `/Users/dev_user/semantic/results/cluster_gt_alignment.json`
- `/Users/dev_user/semantic/results/figures/fig2_cluster_heatmap.png`
- `/Users/dev_user/semantic/results/tables/table2_taxonomy.csv`

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] >70% alignment between R1 clusters and GT conflict types
- [ ] Confusion matrix shows clear diagonal pattern
- [ ] Figure 2 is publication quality
- [ ] R1 discovers at least 1 cluster not in GT (novel insight)
